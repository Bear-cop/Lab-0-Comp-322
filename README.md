Log:

Feb. 1 2020 - Initial commit to create the project in Github. Trying to commit and edit file from Ubuntu terminal. Generally just getting a solid grasp on how to utilize Github and Ubuntu.

Feb. 5 2020 - Deleting an old wrongly formatted file(Lab0.c) to create a properly formatted file(Lab0.c) within a folder in the repository. Writing the beginning of the code used for file reading.

Feb. 6 2020 - Filling in the rest of the code by writing the conversion, printing, and number analysis functions. 

Feb. 7 2020 - Through Ubuntu, accidentally created a separate Lab0.c in the repository separate from the one in the created folder. This in an attempt to commit the current Lab0.c through Ubuntu to run the code in the terminal. The file could not be commited in the first place because of a merge conflict. Deleted this newly created Lab0.c and solved the merege conflict.

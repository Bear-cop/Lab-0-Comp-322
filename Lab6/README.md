added files and such - in spiritd.c for what it seems I need a signal handler and have a normal main method
- in mole.c, I just need to create a new file with correct pathing to it.

in spiritd.c, I got help from my friend and gave me a basic layout of what I should use such as rlimit and having a opening and closing files and mapping it to dev null. At this point im finishing up the signalHandler method, then I will start on the main method soon.

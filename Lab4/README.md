I believe that I am almost done with the code. Just need to clean it up its currenttly filled with warnings but good news 0 errors.
After I edited and made my code prettier, my code has issues that I kinda gave up on solving because somehow it works. After writing the 
bash script it ran normally it seems like. I've changed up my destroy semaphore method by removing the args, and having chopsticks with
left and right positions be global variables. I changed the main method to print signals and display completed work cycle of philospher.
